# HarvardHack2024
Harvard Hackathon Submission. This project aims to be able to alert drivers when the current state of an intersection can cause a potential accident or scene.


1. Get live feed of data 
2. Recognize cars in this data âœ…
3. Determine cars (X,Y) value 
4. Transform (X,Y) values to be a birds eye view perspective (Data set will look like this)
5. Build and Train model... Did the collision crash based on speed or not
6. Use ML (Neural Networks) on the last 24 frames to predict if there is a risk of collision
5. Theoretically, for a constant while loop, we should be able to predict collision or not. Can also keep track of collisions detected
8. Future Steps
    a. Recognize pedestrians in data
    b. Recognize bikers in data
